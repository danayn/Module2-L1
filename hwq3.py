# 4. Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life

 # Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations 
 # and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

 # Task 1: Grocery Store Math
 # Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. 
 # For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic

 #bread can be 8 dollars, peanut butter 5 dollars, and jelly 7 dollars. 

total_cost = 0
bread_price = 8
pb_price = 5
jelly_price = 7
total_cost = bread_price + pb_price + jelly_price
print(total_cost)



 # Task 2: Bank Interest
 # If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the 
 # total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell 
 # us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.
start_balance = 10000
int_rate = 0.07
end_balance = start_balance + (start_balance * int_rate)
print(end_balance)
