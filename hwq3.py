# 3. Python Data Types and type() Function

# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, 
# as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

# Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:

# have put in print statements for type() of variable
variable_a = "Hello, World!"
print(type(variable_a))

variable_b = 23
print(type(variable_b))

variable_c = 3.14
print(type(variable_c))

variable_d = True
print(type(variable_d))
